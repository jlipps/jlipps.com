I got my BA (2004) during some wonderful years as an undergraduate at the [Stanford Philosophy
Department](http://philosophy.stanford.edu/). I can still remember mind-exploding moments in the
Philosophy of Mind or Logic courses I took. And the Philosophy of Language seminars no doubt had
something to do with my eventual studies in [linguistics](/linguistics).

While at Stanford I also took advantage of their co-terminal degree program, which enabled me to
work towards and receive an MA in Philosophy as well, also in 2004. As a grad student, I had the
rewarding experience of TAing a course on medical ethics, as well as some truly fascinating
exposure to the philosophy of quantum mechanics, wherein I finally learned some linear algebra.

In my MA I had several areas of concentration:

*   **Metaphysics, Epistemology, and the Philosophy of Language** - you know, the light stuff.
*   **Logic** - first-order, propositional, or modal, so long as it's formal!
*   **Philosophy of Science** - what assumptions undergird science, as an epistemology and as a practice?
