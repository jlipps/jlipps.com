title: Selected Works
---

While I've never been published in a peer-reviewed philosophy journal, I have continued to write
essays in a philosophical vein from time to time. Here is a selection of pieces written from
college on which I think make an interesting point or another. My preferred discussion topics have
broadened since my undergrad days to encompass the philosophy of technology, philosophical
theology, and more!
