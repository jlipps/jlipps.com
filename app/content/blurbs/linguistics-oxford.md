When I finished my MA in Philosophy, I almost went on to do a PhD but decided to gain some career
experience first. I worked for 5 years and took a sabbatical, during which I took stock of some of
my core interests and passions. Through that process I decided that I wanted to approach language
and the study of language itself in a less amateur fashion. So I did an MPhil in the [Faculty of
Linguistics, Philology, & Phonetics](http://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/) at Oxford University,
supported by a scholarship at [Jesus College](http://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk).

In this program I had several areas of focus:

*   **Syntax** - understanding how words can be put together to form larger units of linguistic
structure.
*   **Morphology** - understanding how words themselves can be put together from smaller
bits.
*   **Computational Linguistics** - using computational techniques to answer linguistic
questions.
*   **The History of Ancient Greek** - charting the path of the Ancient Greek dialects
through roughly 1,000 years of ancient history.

Thanks to the wonderful instruction I received from my professors, and especially my supervisor
[Mary Dalrymple](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~cpgl0015/), my MPhil thesis was submitted to the Oxford
Research Archive for digital publication, and featured on [the department's
website](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/research/mphil-theses) as having earned a distinction.
