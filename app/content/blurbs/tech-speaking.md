I've spoken at dozens of conferences, meetups, and webinars around the world on various topics,
mainly to do with automated web and mobile app testing, or open source development. I'd be happy to
consider speaking at your conference or internal company event! Here is a set of highlights from my
speaking career so far, including video, audio, or slide links when possible. (If you're looking
for information about me to add to an event, you can find my professional bio and headshot for
event purposes at the [About](/about#professional-bio) page).
