I've spoken at dozens of conferences and meetups around the world on various topics, mainly to do
with automated web and mobile app testing, and open source development. I'd be happy to consider
speaking at your conference or internal company event! Here are a few links to videos and slides of
presentations I've given. (You can find my professional bio and headshot for event purposes at the
[About](/about#professional-bio) page).
