I have loved learning and playing with languages ever since I was young. Like many, it was
discovering the wealth of creativity in J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional tongues that opened up a world
of fascination with language. It showed me language as a vehicle for expression and exploration,
not just communication. I've always thoroughly enjoyed learning languages, and have spent time
digging into a variety of them, from Spanish to Swahili! Beyond the practical I also spent a few
years pursuing linguistics academically, which was immensely interesting.
