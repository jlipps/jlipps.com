This site was coded up by hand with lots of love! All the photos you see throughout were taken by
me. I used basic HTML, CSS, and JS, in conjunction with the [Enhance](https://enhance.dev)
framework. I deployed the site to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda) using
[Architect](https://arc.codes), which is the only sane way to interact with AWS. The code for the
site, in the spirit of a more open web, is all up on GitHub as an open source project at
[jlipps/jlipps.com](https://github.com/jlipps/jlipps.com). Hopefully it gives people some ideas for
hosting their own personal pages!
