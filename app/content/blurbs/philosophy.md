When I went off to college, I was planning on majoring in computer science. The trouble is, I'd
also taken to exploring and debating some of the Big Questions, like God's existence, foundations
of morality, the ultimate metaphysical nature of the physical universe, etc... Nothing was quite so
stimulating as trying to get to the bottom of the cosmological argument, to see whether it really
worked or not! So, when the computer science department couldn't figure out where I should start
after I asked them on my first day of college, I decided to focus on philosophy for a while.
Ultimately, I had such a good time I stuck with it. I've still never made any money as
a philosopher, but I certainly feel like a professional! The irony is that I went ahead and became
a career technologist anyway.
