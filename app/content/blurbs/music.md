I've been playing music for as long as I can remember. Starting with a few years of piano lessons
as a child, I opted to switch to trumpet when it came to school. I practiced just enough to stay
involved in the marching bands, concert bands, and jazz bands at my high schools. I also composed
for piano and full wind ensemble. Eventually I migrated to focusing on guitars of various kinds,
and alternative/emo/indie/pop/rock genres came to the fore. I've written and recorded well over 100
different songs, and have performed at numerous venues, including (most notably) going on tour with
my friends' band, [The New Frontiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Frontiers) (while they
were supporting [Manchester Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Orchestra)).
