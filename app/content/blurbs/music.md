I've been playing music for as long as I can remember. Starting with a few years of piano lessons as a child, I opted to switch to trumpet when it came to school. From 6th to 12th grade I practiced just enough to stay involved in the marching bands, concert bands, and jazz bands at my high schools. I also composed for piano and full wind ensemble.

In high school, I had two life-changing experiences: first, I took Music Theory AP. Second, I began playing guitar. These two things defined my musical experience through the present. I explored pop, rock, alternative, punk, and ska music for the first time, and started writing songs with words. That meant that I also sang them; and eventually, my voice got good enough for me to appreciate my own music. In the last 20 or so years since I started playing guitar, I've written and recorded over 100 different songs, and have performed at numerous venues, including going on tour with my friends' band, [The New Frontiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Frontiers) while they were supporting [Manchester Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Orchestra).
