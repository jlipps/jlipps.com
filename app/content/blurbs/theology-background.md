My academic interests in theology tend towards the philosophical, as expected, but in recent years
I have begun to see all fundamental life orientation as expressing one kind of theology or another,
and thus the deep relationship between theologies and all aspects of our modern life. To that end
I have begun integrating my interest in the philosophy of technology with theology, observing that
our attitudes to technological devices are increasingly "theological" despite the non-theistic
beliefs of many of their users.

In additional to more philosophical modes of engaging with theology, I've also begun to appreciate
the field of 'biblical studies' more and more, and place a high premium on the exploration of
cultural and historical backgrounds of texts, not to mention appropriate linguistic analysis of
them. So many elements of what I believed about the Bible growing up have been revolutionized by
exposure to current research in these areas.

I'm currently enrolled (very much part-time) at [Regent College](https://regent-college.edu) in
Vancouver, BC, pursuing a ThM in Interdisciplinary Studies. My area of focus is the theology of
technology, bringing together my lifelong interest and career in technology with considerations of
the transcendent. Specifically, my research is on understanding modern technology and our use of it
from the perspective of the Biblical themes of Creation, Imago Dei, and Fall.
