I have been engaged with the use and development of technology in one form or another since I was
young, and am several decades into my career as a software developer. For the last 10+ years I've
focused heavily on open source work, and have had the privilege of doing a fair bit of speaking on
the conference circuit about specific technical topics as well as the philosophy of technology.
