I have been engaged with the use and development of technology in one form or another since I was
young, and am several decades into my career as a software developer. I consider myself
a generalist and have worked in all kinds of programming languages and application development
stacks. For the last 10+ years I've focused heavily on open source work, and have had the privilege
of doing a fair bit of speaking on the conference circuit about specific technical topics as well
as the philosophy of technology.
