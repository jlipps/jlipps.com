Growing up in a religious household, the language of "God" was all around me. Thinking about God
and the meaning of life became a big part of my mental furniture. It's part of what led me to become
a [philosopher](/philosophy) and to examine the big questions of life from all angles (not just
the angle of religion). Despite my completely non-religious education, I was never persuaded to
reject belief in God and become an atheist. As such, I've always retained an interest in thinking
critically but also faithfully about God.
