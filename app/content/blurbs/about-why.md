title: Why this site?
---

We live in an era of the Internet where most of our ability to share things about ourselves, our
projects, our interests, our opinions, etc..., is controlled by massive corporations and hidden
behind their walls. Social media of various kinds is immensely useful and engaging, but as a user
of these services I've often gotten the feeling that I'm more like a farm animal being raised for
slaughter than anything else.

As a software developer, I'm in the admittedly privileged position of being able to put things on
the Internet on my own, without going through these social media middlegiants. I do so as an
exercise in freedom, and as a nod to an earlier stage of the narrative of the web, where people
made Geocities sites to honour their weird hobbies and put random facts about themselves into the
ether, with the promise of serendipitous connection! I remember this phase fondly for myself, not
least because it stimulated my own love of producing software technology and kickstarted my
self-taught career as a web developer. I hope that we can return to such a state in some measure in
the future, perhaps a bit wiser after our journey through the dark forest of corporate control.
