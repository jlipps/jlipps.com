My stint as a quasi-professional linguist was short-lived. After the completion of my MPhil,
I signed on to do a PhD at the University of Chicago with the intention of pursuing the academic
life. However, during my last year at Oxford I was also working on a tech startup called
[Comendi](/technology#job-comendi), and a few weeks before moving to Chicago my co-founder and
I decided to make the attempt at running Comendi as a real company in San Francisco. So I never
started my PhD, or did much with linguistics academically from that point on. I continue to engage
with language in creative ways (immersive fantasy novel with realistic languages coming sometime
before I die!), however. Anyway, here's some of the work I've done in the area.
