title: Additional Delights

You might think that the myriad categories already featured on this website are more than enough
things for me to be interested in. You'd be right! But I am sneaky. Here are yet more hobbies
I maintain at some low to medium cadence:

<section>

* **Running**: I've trained for three marathons and really enjoy the feeling I get after running about 12 kms.
* **Cycling**: because who doesn't love sitting in one position for hours and getting an increasingly sore rear end.
* **Rock climbing**: along with hiking and mountaineering, this is my favorite outdoor activity. It can be a bit intense, which is why I usually let my friends lead all the hard pitches.
* **Ultimate Frisbee**: The best team sport ever. I played a bit on the club teams at my college and grad school.
* **Yoga**: the hot variety, please.
* **Pickleball**: dink donk!
* **Dungeons & Dragons**: Creative collaborative storytelling! It's so fun. I have another website I made to talk about my D&D adventures, called [Notes from the Underdark](https://underdark.quest)
* **Magic: the Gathering**: Continuing with the theme of being a huge nerd, this is probably my favourite game to play with friends. I often go lose at local tournaments!
* **Writing**: don't tell anyone, but I always have an idea for a novel that I'm never actually writing. Maybe someday I'll finish it/them. (Meanwhile you can read my non-fiction writing at my [blog](https://blog.jlipps.com).)
* **Homebrewing**: nothing so nice as a homemade double IPA! I'm also into making my own cider, mead, spirits, etc...
* **Motorcycling**: I've ridden a few bikes over the years, and keep a Suzuki GS500 in California whenever I go visit family, not least so I can ride around the beautiful wine country with my dad.
