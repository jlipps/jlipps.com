Welcome to the online homepage of Jonathan Lipps! Harking back to an era before social media
rendered personal pages superfluous, this website is meant to inform you, dear reader, of
everything (indeed, probably much more than) you need to know about me.

I'd say this site is designed around the embarrassing theme that I can't be interested in just one
thing. Of course, I like to think that variety of pursuits leads to a more satisfying and
integrated life. So I've selected some of the most prominent of these interests to showcase in
their own sections.
