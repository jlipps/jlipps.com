Welcome to the online homepage of Jonathan Lipps! Harking back to an era before social media
rendered personal pages superfluous, this website is meant to inform you, dear reader, of
everything (indeed, probably much more than) you need to know about me.

I'd say this site is designed around the embarrassing theme that I can't be interested in just one
thing. Of course, I like to think that variety of pursuits leads to a more satisfying and
integrated life. So I've selected some of the most prominent of these interests to showcase in
their own sections.

## Biographical Ramblings

It's a bit hard to say where I'm from. Before I was 6 years old I'd lived in Arizona, California,
and Papua New Guinea. I spent my growing-up years in a little town outside of Dallas called [Cedar
Hill, TX](http://www.cedarhilltx.com/). When we moved there it was a small town of about 10,000,
but since I moved away it has become a booming suburbopolis, replete with all the big box stores
your heart desires and very little of the small town charm I remember.

Anyway, I finished up high school in Orlando, FL, and went off to college in sunny California at
Stanford University in Palo Alto (BA/MA in Philosophy). After finishing these degrees in 2004,
I stuck around Palo Alto, lived with friends in a kind of intentional community, and cut my career
teeth as a freelance software developer for tech startups. At one point I took a sabbatical and
spent the better part of a year in Kenya at a children's home in Nyeri, helping to start various
programs for the kids there.

In 2009 I got the chance to live out a lifelong dream and started another graduate degree at Oxford
University in the UK. This time my studies were in "General Linguistics and Comparative Philology",
which is pretty badass according to me. I was all set to start a PhD in Linguistics at the
University of Chicago in 2011, but at the last minute decided to start a software company in San
Francisco instead. I lived in San Francisco for 5 years and it was an amazing season of working for
exciting tech startups, including some of my own projects. During that time I wrote the popular
Appium automation software which has since become a long-lived and much-loved (or much-bemoaned
depending on who you're talking to) open source project. I've had the good fortune to develop
a very satisfying software development career based around Appium!

In 2016, my then-partner and I moved to beautiful Vancouver, BC, where we had a son. I still live
in Vancouver with our son, enjoying all the amazing things that the Pacific Northwest has to offer.

## Additional Delights

You might think that the myriad categories already featured on this website are more than enough
things for me to be interested in. Not so fast! Here are some other hobbies I maintain at some low
to medium cadence:

<section>

* **Running**: I've trained for three marathons and really enjoy the feeling I get after running about 12 kms.
* **Cycling**: because who doesn't love sitting in one position for hours and getting an increasingly sore rear end.
* **Rock climbing**: along with hiking and mountaineering, this is my favorite outdoor activity. It can be a bit intense, which is why I usually let my friends lead all the hard pitches.
* **Ultimate Frisbee**: The best team sport ever. I played a bit on the club teams at my college and grad school.
* **Yoga**: the hot variety, please.
* **Pickleball**: dink donk!
* **Dungeons & Dragons**: Creative collaborative storytelling! It's so fun. I have another website I made to talk about my D&D adventures, called [Notes from the Underdark](https://underdark.quest)
* **Magic: the Gathering**: Continuing with the theme of being a huge nerd, this is probably my favourite game to play with friends. I often go lose at local tournaments!
* **Writing**: don't tell anyone, but I always have an idea for a novel that I'm never actually writing. Maybe someday I'll finish it/them. (Meanwhile you can read my non-fiction writing at my [blog](https://blog.jlipps.com).)
* **Homebrewing**: nothing so nice as a homemade double IPA! I'm also into making my own cider, mead, spirits, etc...
* **Motorcycling**: I've ridden a few bikes over the years, and keep a Suzuki GS500 in California whenever I go visit family, not least so I can ride around the beautiful wine country with my dad.
