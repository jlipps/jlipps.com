Given my love of Tolkien's fictional languages, it was only natural that I (like many other nerds)
ended up creating constructed languages ('conlangs') of my own, though none of them ever became
very complete. The most fleshed-out project was a language called _Enaselvai_, which has some
pretty obvious affinities with pre-existing natural languages like Latin. I even wrote this paper
about constructed languages and the structure of Enaselvai. You can see some of the script
I created for its writing system in the attached image!
