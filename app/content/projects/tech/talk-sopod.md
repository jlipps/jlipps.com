I was a guest on this StackOverflow Podcast, where we discussed open source community health, the
philosophy of technology, and music. I played a bit of live music for the show, and the full
version of the song I played is also available online: [When There Was Still Code to Write (Ukulele
Version)](https://soundcloud.com/jlipps/when-there-was-still-code-to-write-ukulele-version).
