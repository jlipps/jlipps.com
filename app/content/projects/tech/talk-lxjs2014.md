This was my first opportunity to give a presentation at a tech conference that wasn't about
a technical topic. Instead, I got to share some of my thoughts (and worries) about the place of
technology in our broader lives. In this presentation I tried to elucidate the concept of the
"Device Paradigm" and explain why it mattered to us as practitioners of technology. It was also fun
to build a realtime demo where attendees could write how they're feeling and have it float across
the screen, while I performed an original song written for the event!
