Here's the AppiumConf 2021 keynote, which happened during the Covid-19 pandemic, making it
impossible for us to hold the conference in person. My secret demo for this talk was to produce an
Appium 2 plugin for [automating Unity-based
games](https://github.com/headspinio/appium-altunity-plugin/)! Appium 2 was not yet released and so
the rest of the talk was as discussion about the development process for it.
