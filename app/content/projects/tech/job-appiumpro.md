I maintain [Appium Pro](https://appiumpro.com), a (formerly) weekly blog and newsletter focused on
mobile test automation topics. I started writing Appium Pro in early 2018 along with the founding
of Cloud Grey, and it has become the definitive resource for Appium how-tos and tutorials on the
Internet. HeadSpin acquired AppiumPro in 2020.
