I led the Product Engineering team at [HeadSpin](https://headspin.io), the app UX intelligence
platform. HeadSpin lets you run all kinds of automated, performance, and other UX validation
against your mobile, web, or media app, leveraging real-world devices and locations, along with
a good dose of AI/ML to give you awesome reports about your app's quality. Previously at HeadSpin,
I founded and led [HeadSpin University](https://ui.headspin.io/university), where we featured an
extensive web and mobile test automation course I produced called [Appium and Selenium
Fundamentals](https://ui.headspin.io/university/learn/appium-selenium-fundamentals-2020/units).
Part of my responsibility at HeadSpin was to continue to maintain and support the Appium ecosystem.
