I helped to start (with [Brad Wolfe](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=26072665)) this
company designed to bring creativity and inspiration to online engagement. We encouraged people to
add their own creations to the community; along with each creation was its "backlight", i.e., the
story of what inspired that creation. We built an amazing community of people and a library of
inspiring content. We were also a part of the 2008 fbFund REV accelerator class.
