I previously worked as **Director of Open Source** at the San Francisco-based cloud testing company [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com). At Sauce, I worked on many aspects of the architecture of our web and mobile testing cloud, from backend infrastructure (Python) to frontend interactivity (JavaScript). I built out the [Open Source Engineering Team](https://saucelabs.com/blog/the-sauce-labs-open-source-engineering-team). Our mission was to make sure that the open source projects at the center of our world ([Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org) and [Appium](http://appium.io)) stayed awesome, and that the ecosystem that surrounded our core products received as much attention as it deserved. Of course, I spent much of my time leading and maintaining the Appium project.
