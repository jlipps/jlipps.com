As someone who works as a professional in the field of software automation and automation tools,
I wanted to apply some critical philosophy of technology to the specific topic of automation. This
SauceCon 2017 keynote talk was a perfect opportunity for such reflection! It culminated in
a completely automated performance of a song I wrote with Appium driving various instruments
including a text-to-speech synthesizer. Kind of spooky, actually!
