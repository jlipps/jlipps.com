I helped to start (with [Daniel Conrad](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dconrad)) this social
recommendations company. Rather than giving people a list of business to try, we approached the
recommendations problem with the idea that recommendations are highly relative to someone's needs
and desires. So we built a mechanism for succinctly stating those desires in the form of a question
which people answered---these answers were recommendations which were reused around the site.
