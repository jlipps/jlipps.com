My first foray into the philosophy of technology was via the work of [Albert
Borgmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Borgmann), and specifically his book <em>Technology
and the Character of Contemporary Life</em>. His ideas were so powerful and fruitful for me that
I wanted to get to know them more intimately as well as to make them more easily accessible to
non-philosophers. And so I set out to blog through each chapter of his book, summarizing and
explicating the important points. Ultimately, this work even opened up the possibility to meet the
man himself, and to have the wonderful opportunity to [interview
Albert](https://blog.jlipps.com/2017/05/interviewing-borgmann-part-1/) at his home in Montana.
