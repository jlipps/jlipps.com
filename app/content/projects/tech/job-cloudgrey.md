In 2018 I founded [Cloud Grey](https://cloudgrey.io), the Appium-focused consultancy, to meet the
need of large companies trying to be successful with the tool. Especially in large and complex
testsuites or organizational structures, it's easy to wind up with a sub-optimal Appium setup.
Cloud Grey offered training, testsuite architecture, and a host of other services to enterprise
clients. In my role as founding principle I also advised key companies in the industry.
