Together with Matt Germonprez and Sean Goggins, I published this paper in [First
Monday](https://firstmonday.org), a peer-reviewed journal devoted to the topic of the Internet. The
abstract is as follows:

<section>
Open source projects are transforming. Today, work within open source projects has come to be
influenced by a growing set of companies and individuals who receive financial remuneration for
their engagement. As such, there is a central focus on commoditization and commercialization of
open source products, which drives a trend towards a concealment of the various inner workings that
produce these products. Within this shift, the product becomes a central aim of open source project
engagement, and the means of production becomes incidental. In this paper, we explore the HCI
research and design implications of the transformation of open source projects as part of
commercial work and how we can come to better understand and protect the rising tide of open source
projects.
