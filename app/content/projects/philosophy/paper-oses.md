There is a class of arguments for cosmic design which aim to put the design hypothesis at better
than chance by pointing at apparently finely-tuned aspects of our universe (without which "higher"
life forms like ourselves, or any life at all, would not exist). A common objection to such
arguments says that, given our lack of non-finely-tuned universes to compare against, design
inferences are barred as a result of an observation selection effect. This paper attempts to defeat
that objection (while, it must be said, not offering any additional support to the fine-tuning
argument itself).
