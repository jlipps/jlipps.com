Present-Future is Splendour Hyaline's latest release. It consists of 14 songs written and recorded
over a period of 11 years. The recording process took place primarily in San Francisco, but spanned
my move to Vancouver. It's an indie record with pop rock sensibilities, verging on the epic, with
influences all over the place!

This full-length album was recorded mostly at Spareroom Studios in San Francisco, CA (now
Earthtones Audio in Forestville). I wrote the songs, sang, and played all the tonal instruments.
David Lipps played drums, produced the album, and did all the mixing and mastering. Chris Nyffeler
designed the cover art.
