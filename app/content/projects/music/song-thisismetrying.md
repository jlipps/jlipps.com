Like most people in the world, I sometimes listen to Taylor Swift. This is a bit strange for me,
though, since I typically avoid mega-pop stars like the plague. But you have to respect Ms Swift's
songwriting skills, however famous she has become! In particular, I am enamoured of her album
"folklore", whose production aligns much more with the type of music I normally listen to.

And so, admittedly very late in the game, I've decided to hop on the Swiftie bandwagon with this
cover of one of my favourite tracks off that album. (It is, predictably, probably one of the most
depressing songs available in the Taylor Swift catalogue, just how I like it!)
