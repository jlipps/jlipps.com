This album is the result of a lot of experimentation with composing using electronic instruments
and the exploration of more subtle emotional landscapes. Before this (and still, really) I did not
have much experience with electronic music, certainly not "techno" or "EDM" or "house" or any of
these sub-genres. But I had a keyboard and some synthesizer software so I got to playing around.
I wrote these 5 songs over the course of 2-3 years, and still come back to them from time to time
(particularly the first track). I'm now doing a bit more electronic composition again, and will
hopefully be producing more instrumental electronic music soon!
