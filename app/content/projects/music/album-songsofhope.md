In 2007-2008 I spent about a year living and volunteering at the [Tumaini Children's
Home](https://www.tumaininyeri.org/) in Nyeri, Kenya. Part of my efforts there involved
facilitating music programs for the kids. It turned out there was a robust culture of
songwriting---kids would create vocal melodies and lyrics and sing these songs to one another
(mostly in the form of Christian worship). I worked with a number of these kids to add backing
music to their songs, and recorded them. The resulting album was a really interesting mix of
original East African folk melody (sung in Swahili or Kikuyu) and whatever influences I already
had. All proceeds from the release of this album went/go to Tumaini!

Vocal melodies and words were written by the Tumaini kids. Vocal harmonies and all other
instruments, along with album art, by me.
