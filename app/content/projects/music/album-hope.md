In many ways this 6-song EP was Splendour Hyaline's first record that I was really proud of. We
originally released it in 2006, but the version linked above were remastered and re-released in
2014. I was doing a lot of exploring in my songwriting, and we put together a pretty hard-hitting
EP I think! This record even got reviewed in a print edition of [Paste
Magazine](https://www.pastemagazine.com/), back when print magazines were a thing. The reviewer
compared us to Pedro the Lion / David Bazan, which is pretty fair given that he remains one of my
biggest influences!

As per usual, I wrote the songs, sang, and played the musicky bits. My brother David did the drums
and the mixing magic, and designed the album art.
