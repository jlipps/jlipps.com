I wrote this song while reflecting on global and personal pain and darkness during 2023. In a way
that particularly resonated with me at the nadir of the year, I loved the image of nothingness
pregnant with light, the intention of creativity "hovering" over the chaotic absence of sense, just
about to be revealed for the love that it is. Could this be where we are, in the big scheme of
things? In the roil of chaos, just prior to something better? Could it be where I am, in the little
scheme of my life? "'Cause some of the infinity of love, it turns out, is meant for me." And you.
And everyone.
