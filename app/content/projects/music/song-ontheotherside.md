This is a song / music video recorded with my brother at Earthtones Audio. While the song has
intensely personal and specific meaning for me, I like to think it also says something universal
about significant transitions in life (and death): the courage, fear, loss, and hope involved. We
recorded this song in basically one day while I was visiting on a short trip. I decided to throw up
my phone to capture some video as we were working, and it turned into this really fun way of
showing our recording process and visualizing the different parts as they come in and out of the
song.
