In the summer of 2009 I got a bunch of mp3s from a friend. In this particular batch was an album
called "Shallow Grave" from some artist named "The Tallest Man On Earth", a name which I figured
(correctly, as it turns out) was tongue in cheek.

The album was intense, raw, organic, overcompressed—all things I loved, and none of which I had
previously associated with folk/country/Americana. But that is what was happening. I was
immediately drawn in, and have been following Kristian Matsson's music ever since. I always find
myself coming back to this first record, and often this song in particular. I don’t know if this
story it tells is perhaps intended to be a metaphor, or what. It certainly has a chilling element
to it that belies the beautiful folky melody. Regardless, there’s a sense of wistfulness, of
resignation to oneself and one’s choices that I find compelling.
