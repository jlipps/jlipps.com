Splendour Hyaline's debut! 12 songs of acoustic indie rock with some drums (no bass guitar, mind
you!) This incorporated basically everything I'd written during my undergrad years at Stanford. It
also represents David's and my foray into sound engineering, production, mixing, etc... And it had
the quality to match! Some of these songs are still very dear to my heart, of course. Sadly, it's
not available on any of the streaming services, since I'm not brave enough / don't think anyone
cares! Cover art by David Lipps.
