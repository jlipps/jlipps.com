This little collection of 4 songs was composed of two re-recordings from Splendour Hyaline's first
album, plus two new tracks. Originally released as the "Splendour Hyaline EP" to basically nobody,
and containing some songs which went on to be on the "Hope" record, David and I remixed/remastered
these and re-released them in 2014, with some additional instrumentation. It's basically the oldest
music I've made that I've felt comfortable actually posting on the internet (though maybe I'll get
brave and upload Splendour Hyaline's first album for archival purposes someday). Cover design by
our bud Chris Nyffeler.
