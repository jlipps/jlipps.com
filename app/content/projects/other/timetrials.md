For about a year in the mid aughts I lived and volunteered in Nyeri, Kenya, working with kids at
the [Tumaini Children's Home](https://www.tumaininyeri.org/). Part of what I helped with there was
the development of a program called 'Hope Runs'---designed to help these Kenyan kids connect with
one of their national sports and work towards scholarships and the like based on running. We worked
with local coaches to give the kids access to running training and helped them participate in
events. This is a video I made to promote Hope Runs. It's a sort of 'day in the life' of how things
used to go there!
