This is the major project / small thesis which consituted the capstone of my masters degree in
Theology. It describes how recent efforts to bring Generative AI (GenAI) use into popular demand
have spawned a number of urgent questions about the nature of AI and the consequences of embedding
such systems more deeply into human life. By relying on insights from both philosophy and theology,
I argue that, in addition to the various "external" or existential risks and unintended
consequences of GenAI, its use poses a special risk to the "internal" character of human life.
Because it treats human creative artifacts as raw grist for the content mill, and surrenders the
creative process itself to a technological device, thoughtless GenAI use risks the atrophy of the
creative faculties whose expression is an important part of a flourishing human experience and
vocation.
