At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic there was a lot of discussion around the place of church
in public life during quarantine. Online-only services started to pop up, prompting the question
for many of when church would make the jump to a completely virtual reality. I wrote this article
to explore some of the philosophical and theological foundations of VR and what "VR church" might
even mean as a concept. Spoiler alert: I'm not bullish on VR church!
