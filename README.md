# jlipps.com

This is my personal site, hosted at [jlipps.com](https://jlipps.com). The reason I made this site
is part performance art/statement, as described on the site itself:

> We live in an era of the Internet where most of our ability to share things about ourselves, our
> projects, our interests, our opinions, etc..., is controlled by massive corporations and hidden
> behind their walls. Social media of various kinds is immensely useful and engaging, but as a user
> of these services I've often gotten the feeling that I'm more like a farm animal being raised for
> slaughter than anything else.
>
> As a software developer, I'm in the admittedly privileged position of being able to put things on
> the Internet on my own, without going through these social media middlegiants. I do so as an
> exercise in freedom, and as a nod to an earlier stage of the narrative of the web, where people
> made Geocities sites to honour their weird hobbies and put random facts about themselves into the
> ether, with the promise of serendipitous connection! I remember this phase fondly for myself, not
> least because it stimulated my own love of producing software technology and kickstarted my
> self-taught career as a web developer. I hope that we can return to such a state in some measure in
> the future, perhaps a bit wiser after our journey through the dark forest of corporate control.

Have a look around! Build your own random parts of the web!
